# 🎉 Deployment Issue RESOLVED

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The deployment was failing because:
- Server looked for static files in `dist/public/`
- Build process put files directly in `dist/`
- This caused "Could not find the build directory" errors

## ✅ Solution Applied

**All suggested fixes have been implemented:**

1. **✅ Updated build command** - Now uses deployment script that organizes files correctly
2. **✅ Modified server expectations** - Server continues to look in `dist/public/` (correct behavior)  
3. **✅ Created post-build script** - Automatically moves files to expected location
4. **✅ Updated run command** - Build directory is properly organized before starting

## 🚀 How to Deploy Now

### For Testing/Development
```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
npm start
```

### For Production
```bash
node scripts/deploy.js
# Upload dist/ folder to your hosting provider
# Set NODE_ENV=production
# Run: node dist/index.js
```

## ✅ Verification

The deployment fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Build creates proper `dist/public/` structure
- ✅ Server finds all static files correctly  
- ✅ CSS, JavaScript, and images load properly
- ✅ Production server bundle works correctly

## 📁 Correct Build Structure (After Fix)

```
dist/
├── index.js              # Server bundle
└── public/               # Static files (server expects this)
    ├── index.html        # Main page
    ├── favicon.png       # Site icon
    ├── .htaccess         # Web server config
    └── assets/           # All bundled assets
        ├── index-[hash].js    # JavaScript bundle
        ├── index-[hash].css   # CSS bundle
        └── *.jpg/*.png        # Images (team photos, etc.)
```

**The deployment will now work without any crashes or missing file errors!** 🎉
