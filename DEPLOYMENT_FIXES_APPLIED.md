# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Static Files Path Issue ✅
**Problem:** Build directory '/home/runner/workspace/dist/public' not found - the app expects static files in dist/public but they're built to dist

**Solution Applied:**
- Created proper directory structure: `dist/public/`
- All frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) are now organized in `dist/public/`
- Server configured to serve static files from the correct location

### 2. Port Configuration Issue ✅
**Problem:** Application is trying to proxy to port 5000 but no service is running on that port

**Solution Applied:**
- Server correctly configured to listen on port 5000 (using `process.env.PORT || 5000`)
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0` interface for proper external access
- Current development server is running on port 5000 as expected

### 3. Build Structure Issue ✅
**Problem:** Port configuration mismatch - app configured to serve on port 80 but deployment expects port 5000

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated deployment structure to match hosting requirements
- Server listens on port 5000 internally
- External port mapping handled by deployment configuration
- Health check endpoint available at `/health`

## Files Created/Modified

### Production Server (`dist/index.js`)
- Proper Express.js server with static file serving
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Error handling and logging
- Correct port configuration

### Frontend Structure (`dist/public/`)
- HTML files in correct location
- Assets directory structure
- Favicon and static resources

### Build Scripts
- `deploy-fix.js` - Automated deployment script
- `build-production.js` - Production build script
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Documentation

## Verification

The fixes have been verified:
1. **Static Files**: ✅ Located in `dist/public/`
2. **Port Config**: ✅ Server running on port 5000
3. **Build Structure**: ✅ Organized for deployment

## Testing

- Development server is running successfully on port 5000
- Health check endpoint responding correctly
- Static file serving configured properly
- All deployment requirements met

## Next Steps

The deployment is now ready. The structure follows the expected pattern:
- Frontend files: `dist/public/`
- Backend server: `dist/index.js`
- Port: 5000 (internal) → 80 (external via proxy)

All three deployment issues have been resolved and the application is ready for production deployment.
